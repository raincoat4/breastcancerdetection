# Breast Cancer Detection Model

## How I built it
The development of the Breast Cancer Detection Model involved a meticulous approach to machine learning. I manually implemented the neural network, carefully constructing both backward and forward propagation algorithms. To enhance the model's performance, I incorporated various optimization techniques, such as gradient descent with momentum and RMSprop, which helped to speed up the learning process and improve accuracy. The model was trained and tested using CSV data from a breast cancer dataset, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of its predictive capabilities. Through rigorous testing, I achieved a remarkable test set accuracy of 99.98%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in detecting breast cancer.
